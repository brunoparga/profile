      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">Hi! If I sent you an invite to see
        this page, this means I consider you as both a friend and a rational
        person, someone whose input I value. I currently need help figuring out
        my next steps in life. I'll give an explanation of what's currently
        going on, and after that I'll turn it to you to give me your feedback.
        <br><strong>Please send it to my full name at gmail.com.</strong>

      <h3 class="sub-header font-regular">Tl;dr - The short version</h3>
      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">I want to live in a developed
        country, surrounded by rationalist/EA friends, being signed up for
        cryonics. I want to do EA-related work (including earning to give) as a
        software developer using React + Ruby on Rails, Node.js/Express, or
        Elixir/Phoenix. I am building up my <a href="index.html">portfolio</a>,
        but I need help with connections and improving my plan.

      <h3 class="sub-header font-regular">Desiderata</h3>
      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">
        These are the most important things I want out of life in 2020:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Living in a decent country</strong>
          <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">Being in Brazil stresses me out.
            My time in Argentina last year (less than two months) was fun, but
            the country is not very stable, and politics has changed quite a bit
            there since I left.<br>
            At the moment, I think my order of priority of countries to live in
            is something like this: (1) America - (2) Canada - (3) Anywhere in
            Scandinavia, or Switzerland - (4) Elsewhere in Europe (e.g. Germany)
            - (5) Australia/New Zealand - (6) Japan/South Korea/Taiwan/Singapore.
            <br>
            I am open to changing this, though. I can elaborate on my loose
            criteria if you feel this is relevant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access to a rationalist/EA community</strong>
          <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">I am grateful for the groups I
            had in Brazil. At the same time, I miss having a community with a
            group house as a focal point, like I had in Boston. From my brief
            times in London and Berlin, I think this replicates there, I am sure
            it does in the Bay Area, and it is likely it also does elsewhere in
            the rat/EA-sphere.<br>
            Bonus points for a community where polyamory and cuddle piles are a
            part of the local culture.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access to cryonics</strong>
          <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">The whole time I was in Brazil,
            I always wanted to emigrate within 6 months or so. Thus, I haven't
            really sought the whole paperwork required for cryopreservation. I
            am also not confident my wish would be respected.<br>
            In short, I would like to have this peace of mind, knowing I am
            all signed up correctly for cryonics and that, should something bad
            happen to me, my brain will be preserved.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>An EA-aligned job (earning to give counts)</strong>
          <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">I have been readying myself to
            do work as a Web developer: I self-studied for a while, attended a
            bootcamp, then taught there for just over a year.<br>
            Now I feel ready to take on an actual software development job. This
            is where I expect most of y'all's help will come: I need contacts in
            companies that might hire me. <a href="index.html">This page</a> is
            my portfolio, which I have been trying to make more appealing by
            including more projects.
          </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header font-regular">The current state of things</h3>
      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">As of now, I am living in Chile. I
        moved here because it is the most stable country I can live in without
        already having a job, since there is a residency agreement with Brazil.
        <br>However, the situation here went to sh*t about as soon as I arrived,
        with daily protests, lots of anger and instability. It seems like Chile
        will become the new Argentina (that is not a good thing).
      </p>
      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">
        My current plan, after spending the holidays back in Brazil, is to go
        to Uruguay, which now seems stable enough (pending elections in two
        weeks' time). I feel like I am ready(ish) to start actually looking for
        a job, although I'm not very confident in this process, and help in
        dealing with this lack of confidence would be appreciated.<br>
        I know enough Ruby on Rails to have taught it at my bootcamp, and to have
        a few contributions to <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">an open
        source project</a>. I have also learned Node.js and Express and I know
        a little Elixir.<br>
        In the next several weeks I intend to add to my portfolio page several
        new projects, covering:
        <ul>
          <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
          <li>Node.js/Express</li>
          <li>Elixir/Phoenix</li>
          <li>React.js <small>(which I know <em>very</em> superficially, I'll
            have to work on that. Vue.js or Angular also possible)</small></li>
          <li>GraphQL</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">
        As stated above, moving back to the USA would be my first option if I
        could choose anywhere, but I have a visa restriction there. As things
        stand, I might not be allowed into the country until 2027; having a job
        offer would go a long way towards getting that restriction waived.<br>
        I have personal resources that I am willing to spend on visas and
        immigration lawyers, even for that extra hard process in America
        specifically.

      <h3 class="sub-header font-regular">How you can help</h3>
      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">The point of this page is to pick
        y'all's collective brains for answers to some or all of the following
        questions.<br> Given everything I've explained:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What should I do next?</li>
          <li>What is obvious to you but I am missing?</li>
          <li>(How) can I get a job from a wholly different continent?</li>
          <li>Are there other ways you could help?</li>
          <li>How likely do you think it is that I will be living somewhere that
            matches what I want, with a minimally decent job, by July 1, 2020?</li>
          <li>What can I do to improve that probability?</li>
          <li>What should I be asking but am not and, if you know the answer,
            what is it?</li>
