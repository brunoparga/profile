      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">Hi! If I sent you an invite to see
        this page, this means I consider you as both a friend and a rational
        person, someone whose input I value. I currently need help figuring out
        my next steps in life. I'll give an explanation of what's currently
        going on, and after that I'll turn it to you to give me your feedback.
      </p>
      <h3 class="sub-header font-regular">Desiderata</h3>
      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">
        These are the most important things I want out of life in 2020:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Access to a rationalist/EA community</strong>
          <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">I am grateful for the groups I
            had in Brazil. At the same time, I miss having a community with a
            group house as a focal point, like I had in Boston. From my brief
            times in London and Berlin, I think this replicates there, I am sure
            it does in the Bay Area, and it is likely it also does elsewhere in
            the rat/EA-sphere.<br>
            Bonus points for a community where polyamory and cuddle piles are a
            part of the local culture.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access to cryonics</strong>
          <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">The whole time I was in Brazil,
            I always wanted to emigrate within 6 months or so. Thus, I haven't
            really sought the whole paperwork required for cryopreservation. I
            am also not confident my wish would be respected.<br>
            In short, I would like to have this peace of mind, knowing I am
            all signed up correctly for cryonics and that, should something bad
            happen to me, my brain will be preserved.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>An EA-aligned job (earning to give counts)</strong>
          <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">I have been readying myself to
            do work as a Web developer: I self-studied for a while, attended a
            bootcamp, then taught there for just over a year.<br>
            Now I feel ready to take on an actual software development job. This
            is where I expect most of y'all's help will come: I need contacts in
            companies that might hire me. <a href="index.html">This page</a> is
            my portfolio, which I have been trying to make more appealing by
            including more projects.

      <h3 class="sub-header font-regular">How you can help</h3>
      <p class="font-regular main-p-padding">The point of this page is to pick
        y'all's collective brains for answers to some or all of the following
        questions.<br> Given everything I've explained:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What should I do next?</li>
          <li>What is obvious to you but I am missing?</li>
          <li>Are there other ways you could help?</li>
          <li>How likely do you think it is that I will be living somewhere that
            matches what I want, with a minimally decent job, by July 1, 2020?</li>
          <li>What can I do to improve that probability?</li>
          <li>What should I be asking but am not and, if you know the answer,
            what is it?</li>
