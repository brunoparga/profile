            After majoring in History, freelancing as a translator, serving at
            the Brazilian Foreign Ministry as a diplomat and driving for
            ride-sharing services, I've pivoted to a programming career.

              In this game, you are presented with a series of letters. You must
              find the longest word you can with them. But it may also be in your
              interest to form a short word like <em>hex</em>, since rare letters
              like X score more points...

              An open source project I have been using for a long time and also
              contributing to, PredictionBook aims to teach people <em>
              calibration</em>: out of all the things you say you are 60%
              certain will happen, 60% should actually happen, and the same for
              other confidence levels.
            <br>
              On top of several maintenance activities I've performed for this
              Ruby on Rails/PostgreSQL project, I have introduced the filtering
              tool that allows users to see only predictions that have already
              resolved as right or wrong, or only those still in the future.
            <br>
              Further improvements to the app are planned...
